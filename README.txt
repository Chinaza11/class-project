127.0.0.1 leads to the homepage and from here, you have three options to select from that can take you to add to the data
manually or add it via a form or the dashboard.

If you proceed to the dashboard, you have several options to choose from: sum stat, sum stat by year, graphs, map, input
data for predictions and view your predictions.

Building of machine learning model was done in jupyter. File is titled "machine_learning.ipynb". 
Joblib was used for saving built model, I had some issues with pickle

Two databases were made: one was for building the model and the other was for collecting data inputs for predictions.

I could only deploy the homepage to my server, I couldn't proceed any further.


Thank you.
